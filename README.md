## Executive Summary

Most entrepreneurs fail not because their product is bad, but because running a business is hard. Founders spend the majority of their time on administration, compliance, and technical setup — not on product or customers.

Cvpe Scvle flips that ratio. We are an Operating System for African businesses: a Business Infrastructure as a Service (BIaaS). We provide the entire back-office infrastructure — legal, technical, marketing, and compliance — so founders can focus entirely on their product and customers.

Our goal: become the invisible backbone of the digital economy by capturing clients at inception and retaining them through every stage of growth.

## Problem

The friction for founders today:
- Fragmented vendors: lawyers, web devs, marketing agencies, and compliance consultants operate in silos.
- High cost and slow speed: stitching together vendors is expensive and time-consuming.
- Operational risk: lack of standardized systems leads to security, compliance, and scaling failures.

---

## Solution: Four Pillars

We replace multiple disconnected vendors with one unified partner that owns the business lifecycle.

### Pillar 1 — The Launch Lab (Foundation)
Function: Corporate Midwifery — we birth the business correctly.

What we do:
- CIPC registration
- Business banking setup (via banking partners)
- Domain registration
- Payment gateway integration

Client benefit: Walk in with an idea; walk out with a fully legal, bankable entity in days, not months.

### Pillar 2 — The Digital Studio (Technology)
Function: The Digital Engine.

What we do:
- Custom software and app development (standardized stack)
- E-commerce stores (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Cloud setup and infrastructure
- Scalable, maintainable codebases

Client benefit: A standardized, production-ready tech stack from Day 1 — no "spaghetti code."

### Pillar 3 — The Growth Division (Amplification)
Function: The Loudspeaker.

What we do:
- SEO and content strategy
- Paid media and ad campaigns
- Social content production and management
- Conversion optimization and analytics

Client benefit: Turn beautiful products into revenue using data-driven acquisition.

### Pillar 4 — The Compliance Arm (Protection)
Function: The Shield.

What we do:
- Tax (SARS) advisory and filing
- Labour law and payroll compliance
- POPIA (data privacy) advisory and implementation
- B-BBEE strategy and reporting

Client benefit: Peace of mind — no surprise audits or fines.

## Lifecycle Strategy — How We Win

We sell a journey, not just a service. The lifecycle is built to capture and retain clients through vertical integration:

- The Hook (Inception): Low-friction offering (e.g., CIPC registration) attracts founders.
- The Upsell (Integration): Offer website, bank account and payment integration immediately.
- The Lock-in (Growth): Once the platform is live, run acquisition campaigns to generate the first sales.
- The Retention (Compliance): As revenue grows, take over payroll, taxes, and compliance so the founder stays compliant and focused.

Result: Deep integration into a single vendor ecosystem that is costly and difficult to replace.

## Commercial Model & ROI

We use a hybrid revenue model of one-off setup fees and recurring revenue (MRR).

### Pricing Tiers

- Starter (Early-stage founders)
  - Services: CIPC, bank setup, basic landing page, standard T&Cs
  - Revenue model: One-off setup fee

- Growth (SMEs generating revenue)
  - Services: E‑commerce maintenance, social media management, basic bookkeeping
  - Revenue model: Monthly retainer

- Enterprise (Established companies)
  - Services: Custom software development, full compliance officer, aggressive marketing
  - Revenue model: High-value retainer + percentage of ad spend

### Why clients buy (ROI)
- Cost efficiency: Our full team costs a fraction of hiring full-time specialists.
- Speed to market: Launch time reduced from ~3 months to ~2 weeks.
- Risk reduction: Professional compliance prevents costly legal mistakes and fines.

## Operational Efficiency — The "Secret Sauce"

To be profitable and repeatable we focus on systems, not bespoke one-offs.

- Standardized tech stack: We pick and master a small set of technologies (e.g., React/Node for apps, Shopify for retail) to enable reuse and rapid delivery.
- Partnership network: Integrate with banks, legal firms, and payment gateways rather than building them.
- Focus sectors: Start deep in Fintech, E-commerce, and Clean Energy to build domain expertise and repeatable compliance frameworks.

## Focus Sectors

Initial focus:
- Fintech
- E-commerce
- Clean Energy

This sector focus allows us to build templates, regulatory playbooks, and rapid onboarding flows tailored to the most promising markets.

## Roadmap to Launch

Phase 1 — The Core Team:
- Hire 4 Heads of Department: Legal, Tech, Marketing, Operations.

## How it works — Onboarding & Customer Journey

Typical onboarding flow:
1. Founder signs up for a Starter package (CIPC registration).
2. Account manager runs a discovery session and proposes packages.
3. Launch Lab completes registration and bank integration.
4. Digital Studio builds the MVP website/store using standardized templates.
5. Growth Division runs initial campaigns to drive first sales.
6. Compliance Arm periodically audits and handles payroll/taxes as revenue grows.
